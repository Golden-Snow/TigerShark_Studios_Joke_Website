Hi! 
I just wanted to say that i had a blast making this website, and i bet you can see that when you look into the code xP
Tho I'm not the best with websites, especially since i dont know how to properly make images and text scale right with containers, 
i did have alot of fun making this and it was quite a learning experience. i am actually looking forward to the next task xD
hopefully it has as much creative freedom as this one did! :3 

For safty reason, incase the website looks shit, try to zoom in or out abit, i made the website first on my school laptop, but then it didnt scale, but all looked good.
then when i got home the website was really small because the screen on my school laptop was around 1200px wide. and this screen im sending from now is 1900 by 1080 something. 
What i changed to try to scale it right was to introduce prosentage instead of pixels, but for some reason i do struggle to size down the images and text at the right places when you zoom out of the size i made it in...
hopefully i can learn that to next time as i am really dedicated to this, and it was alot of fun! xD

By the way, I should mention that I am the owner of a company based in Britain called TigerShark Studios LTD.
Don't worry about the content on the website, it's purely a joke! I legally have to clarify that TigerShark Studios LTD does not sell any body armor, protection services, or stripper services. 
We also donâ€™t offer any sign-ups to meet "women in your area" or any area for that matter.

Lastly, TigerShark Studios LTD reserves all rights regarding the use, distribution, or commercial usage of this website and its content.
